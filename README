  And display the defined macros in your source code after executing.

  When we analysis the source code written by another person, a lot of
  #ifdef are troublesome very much.  This script helps you to analysis it by
  removing undefined area.
  Please see the example. It helps you to understand this script work.

               3 // comment
  String : Add these strings into macro list

    cancel, please undo (u).
 2. If some macro are defined in the include files, this script doesn't
    work exactly.
